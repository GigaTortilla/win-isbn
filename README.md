# win-isbn
This is the Windows Forms implementation of my [isbn-verifier](https://github.com/GigaTortilla/isbn-verifier) with additional features. 

The most recent additions were conversion between ISBN versions and country code resolution via the `RangeMessage.xml` generated by the International ISBN Agency.

## Upcoming features
- additional number validation (ISSN, ISMN, etc.)
- dynamic access to the RangeMessage through downloading of the current version on startup
